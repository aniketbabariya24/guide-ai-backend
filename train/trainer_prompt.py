Q: "My daughter is 19 mnths. But jab usko me koi chij nai deti hu ya uski koi zid Puri nai kti hu tou wo mujhe hit karti haiShe is just 19 mnths..how can I control this behaviourYa kabhi kabhi wo masti me b mujhe hit kar deti hai.
I tell her hitting noo..nd wo khud b bolti hai hitting nooo..but not regularly..but spcly wen i don't listen to her"
A : "Meherr ji - sorry for the late reply. Aapki beti choti hai. Is umar mein kuch na milne pe kaise behave karna hai bachon ko pata nahin hota. Emotion pe kaabu nahin hota. Lekin bachon ka bhi maarna rok sakte hai. Thoda time laga ke.
Kabhi bhi jiss cheez ke liye bacha zid kar raha hai woh puri nahin karni kyonki phir bachey ko lagta hai ke maarne se cheez milegi. So a no means a no. But pyaar se.
Aap calm aawaaz mein usko bol sakti hai - Not using hands and feet. Mujhe lagti hai. Same line hi humein baar baar use karni hai.
Phir Aap uski feeling ko acknowledge karo. Ke aapko woh chahiye. Haan? Mujhe pata hai. Mujhe pata hai aapko aacha lagta hai. Lekin maarne se kabhi nahin milega. Mummy loves you. 
Bachon ke nervous system ko touch karne se calmnes milti hai. Unko touch karke pyaar se mana karenge to baat samajne ka chance zyada hai.
Yeh sab karke hum apne bachey ko sikha rahe hai ke how to be in control of their emotions. Yeh imp learning sabse pehle maa baap se hi aati hai :-)
Lots of love to your family "

Q: "So the thing is, I’ve a 1 year old. When he was hit by something or got hurt or when he falls down, immediately my family members start hitting that object so that he calms down. I’m not liking this behaviour. They are failing to understand a point that eventually he starts blaming someone else or something else if anything goes wrong instead of regulating his emotions. No matter how many times I try to express this to my family members, they brush it off and say that they’ll learn slowly when they get bigger"
A: "Try this - rather than advising. Ask them questions to chat up, don’t go with a closed mind. For eg why do you hit the other thing, where did you learn this from"
--------------------------------
Q: "How I can make my child wake up early to school. She just wakes up at 7 am where her school is for 8. And top of that she is a picky eater. Needs atleast 40 min of time for breakfast itself. I start waking her up from 6. This is becoming our daily thing. I'm helpless and showing frustration on her. I want to change this situation. What can I do".
A: ""i faced similar thing with my daughter. We did couple of things
- slept on time the previous day
- spoke to our daughter that we need to leave for school at X time. And before that she has to
- get ready
- eat food
After that, my daughter completely changed. She does needs some reminder. But 90percent is gone because she knows that if she doesn’t get ready and her school has a cut off time of 8.45am. And if she doesn’t get school on time, she will have to spend a day at home when all her friends will be at school. So actually, there is sense of agency. And this is what we need to activate in every child. Their own sense of agency to do things. We can’t keep pushing them. Then the sense of agency goes away. So you need to take a step back and let the child be responsible.""

Q: "I am a mother to a 3.5 year old girl. Recently she threw a tantrum. She wants to watch tv for the whole day. Also she therw the food in the plate in anger. For not letting her watch tv. Cried for hours and then stopped on her own. Feeling guilty because I beat her out of frustration. Was continuous crying and not ready to listen at all. How to help her understand. This was the first time she did this... Please help."
A: ""what has happened has happened. She lost her cool, you lost yours :-) that’s ok.
You can give her a hug and say sorry to her for hitting. And tell her that you love her. Young kids can’t make the connection between vyavahar and maar.
Going forward your solution lies in agreeing on say 30 min everyday for TV rule. And following it religiously so that she can trust you. This will 100percent stop"
